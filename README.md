Password Manager that creates a secure password.

It creates a Folder called "AUTOPLAY 2" on the desktop, inside the folder it asks you to put an input that creates a {someName}.txt, which will contain an email, an username (if required) and a secure password.

Now you can specify the numbers of characters your password will have.

When program finishes, it opens {someName}.txt.

The password will automatically be copied to your clipboard.
